The velocity can vary depending on the characteristics of the medium the wave is traveling through. For example, sound waves travel at different velocities in air, water, and solids.",

In other words, it is the length of one complete cycle of the wave. For example, in a sound wave, the wavelength corresponds to the distance between two adjacent compressions or rarefactions. In a light wave, it represents the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs.",
        "3. Frequency (f): The frequency of a wave refers to the number of complete cycles or oscillations that the wave completes in one second. It quantifies how many times a wave repeats itself within a given time period. Frequency is typically measured in hertz (Hz), where 1 Hz represents one cycle per second. The higher the frequency, the more cycles the wave completes in a given time, and the higher the pitch or tone (in the case of sound waves)."
